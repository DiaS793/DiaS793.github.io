                        This project is called Virtual Pet. It is a game where the user has to make several choices in order to take care of a pet. The objective of this
                        game is to get the pet's needs to a hundred or more in order to win. The goal of this project is the understanding and practice of Java from
                        making methods and functions as well as contractors and manipulating them to make a functioning game.

                        <h3>Project 2</h3>
                        <a href="https://github.com/2021-October-Java-PT/virtual-pet-shelter-DiaS793"> Virtual Pet Shelter</a>
                        <img src="images\project 2.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                        The second project is called Virtual Shelter. In this project, it adds another level of complexity to the original Virtual Pet. This time the game adds new,
                        more complicated code such as creating a hash map and array lists to create collections to add, find, and remove constructors in the game. These methods were
                        used as a way to admit new pets to the shelter and find different pets using key-value pairs so that instead of, for example, playing with all pets, the user could 
                        pick one pet via their name to play with. The remove function worked as a way to adopt pets.

                        <h3>Project 3</h3>
                        <a href="https://github.com/2021-October-Java-PT/virtual-pets-amok-DiaS793"> Virtual Pet Amok</a>

                        <p>
                        This last project takes the basses of both Virtual Pet and Virtual Shelter and adds to it Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation or APIE, an important concept for Object-Oriented Programming. With this project, the game becomes even more complex as it is introduced to the concept of Parent and Child Classes.
                        It utilizes one Abstract Class and one Interface that helps to keep the game in this code organized as it takes on ways to ensure that different pets with different needs
                        are fulfilled without those different needs being used by the pets they are not intended for.
